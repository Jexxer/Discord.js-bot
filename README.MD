# SEI-712 Discord Bot

## Description
SEI-712 is currently under development as a side project while I attend General Assembly's SEI (Software Engineering Immersive) with the intent of storing all the resources and useful links I encounter. 

This Discord bot was built in JavaScript using the Discord.js module found [here](https://discord.js.org/#/)

## Commands
### !ping
This was the first command I built for testing purpose. Will be removed in the future.

### !links
This command hosts the main links that my classmates and I visit almost everyday in a single embed. Very useful when someone asks for to the calendar or zoom link.

# Getting Started
Clone down the repo like normal and cd into the directory to run the following command in your terminal.
```
npm i
```

Do not change anything in the Structures Directory. This will cause Commands and Events to fail.
